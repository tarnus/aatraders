Swift Mailer TODO List
-------------------------

In 3.3.x:

  * Add an eventCancelled property and setEventCancelled() method all events
  * Merge Swift_Connection and Swift_ConnectionBase
  * Create a SignedMessage class using openssl_pcks7_sign()


General:

  * Add VERP functionality, probably via plugin
  * Possibly make ConnectionRotator/Multi deal with failied connections during the
    send process - again, for batch mailing. Currently these connections only check
    for failures at connection time.
  * Refactor code in Swift_Message_Headers and Swift_Message_Encoder
    - There is some post-processing of strings done in the headers class which could
      be handled in the encoder.
