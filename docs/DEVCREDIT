Alien Assault Traders was originally based off of the original BlackNova Traders and 
Nova Gaming System code (specifically the .54 release of NGS). Their 
CHANGELOG information can be found in their project files.

Current versions of AATrade are based off an original code base that doesn't incorporate any code from BNT or NGS.
