This would mean that all of the federation sectors would be realspace close to each other so alot smaller engines could be used to travel between them. \r\n\r\nAlso, realspace traveling between two federation sectors would take alot fewer turns than anywhere else in the universe. This is because federation sectors would have special realspace boosters that help ships travel between federation sectors using less turns for their engine size.

Where players use turns that are accumulated over time to trade goods and build empires and take over the universe. This game started out as a fork from the Nova Gaming System and Black Nova Traders. We saw great promise in the game but thought the direction being taken by the original authors was too limited.\r\nSo we sat down and came up with many ideas that would foster long term game play and allow great expansion of the game. We have added many new features that greatly expand upon the game and that everyone has welcomed with open and eager arms. With the release of 0.30 the game has taken an evolutionary step and plays quite a bit different than its predecessors. We have plans for many more additions and enhancements for the game and we are always open to suggestions. Be sure to visit our web site at Alien Assault Traders.\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n\r\nYou are the captain of a space ship, and are embarking on a journey that may lead you to be the master of the universe, or be turned into space dust by the other traders seeking their fortune. Your mission is to go from sector to sector trading different things in order to make a profit. You have just purchased a small trader ship and you must trade to make credits to upgrade your ship and start your new empire. When your profit grows, you go upgrade your ship and make it bigger so you can carry more cargo and make more money. You will find different planets as you move around, some are empty, some are owned by other players. You can claim empty planets and move people there and make it big, or you can attack other players'' ships or planets if your ship has good enough weapons and armor. Everything you do well will earn you points, and at the end of the day, if you are not killed by another player and you have a higher score, then you are learning to play the game. As the saying goes- "the one with the most, wins."\r\n\r\nThis is a turn based web only game. The game gives you a number of turns to start, and adds turns every update. Each update is around 5 minutes. All of these setting are dependent on the administrator hosting the game and may vary somewhat. (check the game settings) The goal is to achieve the most you can in as few turns as possible. Movement is what will take most of your turns. Other activities that use turns are full sector scan, trading and planet scan. \r\n\r\nWhen you first login you will be taken to the Options screen. This screen allows you to customize several different things about the game. You may also edit this screen after logging into the game from the Options tab on the Main menu.\r\n\r\nPassword- This is where you can change the random password the system sent you to something you can more easily remember. \r\n\r\nLanguage - This is your default language. We currently provide support for many different languages although they may not be complete. We are slowly getting the corrected translations from our players for the many different languages. \r\n\r\nTemplates - This allows you to change the page layout for your game. \r\n\r\nAvatars - Each player can select from a directory of images what they want their character to look like or if the server supports it they can upload their own. Avatars are 64 pixel width X 64 pixel height graphics, either gif''s or jpg''s. Please keep your uploaded avatars clean so game Admins don''t have to do as much censorship work. \r\n\r\nTeam Icons - Once you set up a team you can select an icon for your team. This can only be done by the team coordinator. Much like avatars you can also upload your own and they must be 64 pixel width X 64 pixel height graphics, either gif''s or jpg''s.\r\n \r\nLocal and Galaxy Map Width - This controls how many sectors should be displayed per line of the local and galaxy map display. The default setting is 50 sectors and should fit on most displays. If you have a smaller or larger browser window adjust the number per line to fit.\r\n\r\nProfiles - Help track your scores for all the games you are playing in. You can login to the profiles server at http://www.aatraders.com and create a profile. Once your profile is created you can build your mini profiles site with information about your character. Communicate with other players, write your own blog or comment on other players. You tie your profile to a game by clicking the click here area at the bottom of the options page. It will ask you for your profile password. Once you submit it, you should have a link in the rankings tied directly to your profile site. If this did not work you may have to delete your profile out of the game and try again. \r\n ', 5, 1, 3);

All sectors surrounding Earth are Federation space. This is very important to know for your first few days. To move to another sector you can use a warp path, or as you upgrade your ship, you can travel through real space (RS). \r\n\r\nWarping\r\nIn the warp menu window you will notice that there are links to other sectors. To go to one of those sectors you just click on that sector''s name. A warp link uses 1 turn to move. \r\n\r\nOn the right of a sector''s name there is a scan option. Use this option to scan for mines, fighters and other players in that sector. \r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the warp window there is a full scan option. The full scan option will scan all sectors connected to the current sector and open a window with the results. The full scan option will use one turn, while a single scan will not use turns. During your first few days you can use the full scan option to populate your galaxy map. If you move to a sector that has multiple connecting sectors you can scan all of them at once and keep moving to sectors that have multiple warps. This is a good way to explore the galaxy and fill in your map. \r\n\r\nIn the warp window you will notice that sectors have icons next to them. These icons show what type of port is located in that sector. The port icon tells what the port is selling, but not what they are buying. \r\n\r\nIf the sector has a F> it is Federation space. This is important to know. If you are lost and need to find your way back to Sol then warp until you get to a federation space sector. From a federation sector you may RS to earth without using too many turns. The green warps mean that the sector has a two way link, one to the sector and one back to your current sector. This makes finding trade routes a lot easier. You can check the ports with green links for the correct corresponding trading commodities. The colored links only relate to Fed space sectors.\r\n\r\nReal Space\r\nNot all sectors are connected with a warp tunnel. To get to these sectors you have to travel through real space. Above the Warp window there is a real space window. With this window you can travel through real space to get to your destination. RS uses a lot of turns at the start of the game and when your engines are small. Because of this and for safety its best to stick with warping. At the very top of the real space window is the 3D galaxy position map. This shows where you are in relation to the sectors in the galaxy. \r\nBelow that is the local real space map. The red dot in the center is where you currently are. The local map will show icons for ports and X''s for empty sectors you have already visited. If you have not been to a sector the RS local map will show a question mark. The Federation space sectors will be highlighted in green. Sectors controlled by other players will also be highlighted. \r\nIf you place your mouse cursor on a sector in the RS box a popup will show how many turns it will take to RS to that sector. You may move (RS) to any sector in the box by just clicking on it.\r\n\r\nWarning: there is no way to scan a real space sector, so be forewarned you may be warping into a minefield. \r\n\r\nThis may be your only option if you follow a one way warp or get tossed from fed space into a detached sector. As you upgrade your engines your RS turns used will drop. If RS takes 100 turns with a level 1 engine it may only take 10 turns with a level 150 and 1 turn with a level 300. As you can see as you get bigger engines the turns even out.(RS in Fed space uses 25% less turns than normal space.) \r\n\r\nUnder the local real space box is a RS to last sector dropdown arrow. This allows you to return to a sector visited in the last 5-6 moves. \r\nBelow that is the RS to: box. You may use the box to RS to a sector you enter in the box by hitting the Go button or just determine how many turns it will take to get there with the ? button. \r\n\r\nYou may notice the sector notes options in between the RS map and the RS dropdown.(may be moved to new location in future versions) This option allows you to make or view notes on a sector that you are in. Use this as much as possible. It will keep your desk neater (my wife likes this) and notes are available when you need them.  ', 6, 1, 3);

In version 0.30 the shipyards are located on a based planet. Once you have based a planet you have an Access the Shipyard option in the Planet Options Screen.\r\n\r\nOnce you click this link the shipyard menu will come up. This is where you buy or store your ships. \r\n\r\nYou can click on the ship you wish to purchase to bring up the base Tech level settings. You may increase the base tech levels before purchasing the ship. This may save you from visiting an upgrade port. If you don''t have enough money to buy the ship then the price box will reflect "Not Enough Credits". Below the price box is the amount of turns you need to have to buy the ship. These turns are immediately deducted from your available turns. The Federation and Alliance Vessels are not available to you even if you can see their statistics. \r\n\r\nShip Classes - When buying your ships each ship is useful for particular things so you will find you will need many ships for different jobs. Don''t just carry one ship as the more ships you have, the better off you will be if you happen to lose one. Pay close attention to the min/max levels when buying your ship so you can get the biggest bang for the buck. Also don''t discount owning smaller ships, they are extremely useful in scouting out areas safely and if you lose them you don''t lose your best ships. Hull size makes a difference when scouting, because hull size is what determines how many mines you hit\r\n\r\nShips\r\nYour ship is your key to moving around the galaxy. In AATraders you can have more than one ship as ships can have many different uses. Some ships are better at one thing than another. Below are ship components and what they do for your ship. \r\n\r\nHull - Your hull is the key to making credits trading commodities. The larger the hull, the more cargo you can carry which means the more credits you can make per trade. The bigger the hull the less turns it takes to colonize a planet\r\nEngine - Control how fast you move throughout the galaxy. The higher your engines the less turns it will cost you to real space over distances. Your engines will also help you in combat in either chasing down an enemy or avoiding your enemy. Don''t downplay the importance of engines as they will save your ship someday.\r\n\r\nPower - is what gives both your beams and shields their energy levels, and controls how much energy storage you have on your ship. Make sure you at least match the power level with your shields and beams or you may be under powered when under attack and will not be able to use your full beam strength or maintain shields under attack. Also to use warp editors it helps to have an excess amount of energy.\r\n\r\nFighter Bay - controls how many fighters you can carry or deploy at one time. It also controls how well your navigation computer works. The higher your fighter bay level the farther your navigation computer can compute warp paths.\r\nSensors - Controls how well you detect spies, planets, mines and fighters and enables your scans to be more accurate. This works best if your sensors are higher than a planet''s ECM or a ship''s cloak level.\r\n\r\nArmor - protects your ship from being destroyed when attacking or being attacked. Primarily torpedoes will do the most damage to armor. As your armor is damaged the more chances that you will have for overall tech damage.\r\nShields - Protects your armor from being damaged. Energy will hold your shields up, but beams are the primary weapon against shields so if an attackers beam level is higher or you do not have the energy to support your shields, the beams will bust past your shields enabling the remaining beams and torpedoes to penetrate your armor. Caution: Shields are not operational in attack and runs. Sector defenses will directly affect your armor.\r\n\r\nBeam Weapon - Your primary weapon for busting through shields. \r\nTorpedo launcher - Controls how many torpedoes/mines you can deploy and carry. Torpedoes are hugely useful in attacks as the torpedoes are what does the most damage when attacking and busting armor.\r\n\r\nCloak - is used to mask your ship from scans and hides your ship from a smaller cloaked ship. Its not 100% that you won''t be detected, but it helps. Also when you try to send spies to an enemy planet the spy uses your ship cloak level at the time you dropped them on the planet to try to sneak to the planet surface.\r\n\r\nECM - Electronic Counter Measures are used to helps confuse incoming torpedoes, fighters and beams so all incoming attacks become less effective \r\nDamage Levels - You will notice that there are damage levels for each item you can upgrade on a ship. When your armor is damaged sometimes you will receive tech damage. This damage can only be repaired at a spacedock. So pay close attention when you receive damage, you cannot upgrade a tech that is damaged you must repair it first.\r\n\r\nEmergency Warp Device - This is very handy if you are attacked. Depending on the size of your ship when your attacked there is a chance that you will automatically warp away. You can also manually use it to escape sectors where you get stuck behind sector defense or running away quickly from an enemy. But you will never know where you will warp to. It is a random place throughout the galaxy including SG''s so it might be a good idea to keep more than one in case you get stuck a second time.\r\n\r\nEscape Pod - This is your lifeline in the game. Forget an escape pod and your ship is destroyed, all your planets go independent your bank account is emptied and you are kicked out of the game for 1 to 3 days depending on settings.\r\nFuel Scoop - This allows you to scoop energy as you real space from sector to sector.

If they want fighter support for their sectors they will have to upgrade at least their Fighter Bay tech.\r\n\r\nPlayers can still fill their sectors with as many mines as they wish. Smile\r\n\r\nIf the sector doesn''t contain any of your own planets or team planets or is a zero planet sector you will not be able to deploy any SD fighters.\r\n\r\nAlso, any planets must be BASED before they can support SD fighters. If you attack and capture a planet with 200 Fighter Bay tech it will not support any SD fighters until you base it.\r\n\r\nSector Defence will now attack if you attack a planet while they are on guard. So don''t expect to cloak in and take the planets at will anymore without the sector defence making you pay for your insolence. Sector defence now requires 10X the amount of energy it used to, so don''t expect to be dropping billions of fighters to protect your home.\r\n\r\nPlanets must be BASED before they can provide energy to support sector defense fighters. If your planets are unbased then any sector defense fighters in the sector will degrade. \r\n\r\n<strong>Direct SD attack and Attack and Run</strong>\r\n\r\nWe have a number of checks to prevent larger players from exploiting smaller players through a bounty system. Most of these checks are on all attacks to any players resources.\r\n\r\nAn example is doing an Attack and Run on sector defense. If a player would get a bounty when attacking any of the planets in the sector then their A&amp;R is completely useless. They basically lose all of their fighters and torps while the SD attacks them.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the same wasn''t true for normal straight forward attacks on sector defense.\r\n\r\nLarger players were exploiting this fault by completely wiping out any small players sector defense and then calling in a smaller player to attack the planets. It basically made it totally USELESS for any small player to spend money on placing sector defense. Why should they when any large player would wipe it all out easily. In other words it was virtually a waste of money for the smaller player. Sure it kept out the other smaller players but that wouldn''t save them for long. The smaller players were learning to call in a friendly big player to help them out by wiping out the SD for them.\r\n\r\nThis was very unbalanced and too much of an exploit. It was also completely inconsistent with how combat worked in the game.\r\n\r\nSo we basically move 4 lines of code from the A&amp;R to the normal SD Attack.

The more energy being carried the more damage the ship will suffer. \r\n\r\nThere is only ONE way to avoid a successfully launched Sector Missile. Your ships sensors must be high enough to defeat the attacking ships cloak tech. When the Sector Missile is launched it assumes the cloak tech level of the ship that fired it. If your sensors do not detect the Sector Missile when it warps into your sector then you WILL get hit. \r\n\r\nIf your sensors DO detect the incoming Sector Missile you have only TWO ways to avoid being hit. You will try to out maneuver the missile but since it was a surprise attack and the missile is so fast you may not be able to avoid it. The missile takes on the Engine tech of the attacking ship. Since you have been surprised by the Sector Missile your Engine tech level is degraded to 50% of its current tech level. So you may have a very hard time avoiding it. \r\n\r\nIf you can''t avoid the Sector Missile you resort to a last ditch effort with the Emergency Warp Device. The EWD will operate just the same as if you were attacked by a ship in the same sector as your ship. \r\n\r\nIf the EWD fails then you WILL be hit by the Sector Missile and take damage. \r\n\r\nIf the target ships sensors detect the incoming Sector Missile an Instant Message and a Log Entry is made giving the NAME of the attacker and the SECTOR NAME where the Sector Missile was fired. \r\n\r\nThe Sector Missile uses an energy feedback loop through the targets shields. Basically the Sector Missile uses the target ships own defenses to attack itself. \r\n\r\nThe amount of energy being carried by the target determines how much energy will be used to attack the shields and armor. The more energy, the more damage inflicted. Sixty percent of the available energy is used to attack the shields. The Shield tech will use what it can of the energy that is left to power the shields. \r\n\r\nIf the shields are depleted by the energy used by the Sector Missile then any remaining energy will attack the ships armor. \r\n\r\nThe Sector Missile attack may cause ALL of the ships energy to be drained. This really depends upon the amount of energy the ships Shield tech level needs for a single attack and the Power tech level. There could still be some energy left over. \r\n\r\nFiring a SECOND Sector Missile at a ship is going to be a complete waste of time and money. The Sector Missile works off the available energy on the target ship. The first hit by a Sector Missile will usually drain off almost all, if not all energy leaving nothing to be used by a second Sector Missile hit. You should follow a Sector Missile attack with a normal Ship to Ship attack. \r\n\r\nThe target ship may not take any armor damage if it isn''t carrying much energy. Ships can reduce the possibility of taking armor damage by carrying less energy but then they open themselves up to normal Ship to Ship attacks. ', 13, 1, 3);

You will notice a dropdown box to the right of the planet selections. You can select the commodity you would like to pickup from that planet when trading. If you want to move goods off the planet to another planet or port you can by selecting Goods. If you select None then nothing will be picked up from the planet.\r\n\r\nIn 0.21 you had a master setting for trading Colonists, Energy, Fighters and Torpedoes. If you wanted to make a change in what was being traded on a traderoute you had to change the master setting and it affected every traderoute.
