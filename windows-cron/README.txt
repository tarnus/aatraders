Cron for Windows - 1.1
----------------------

This little package of freeware will run a "cron" job 
every five minutes to trigger cron processes within 
your Windows-based AATraders installation.

On Unix machines you can use the built-in cron package 
to call your scheduler.  This package was created because 
there was no standard equivalent on Windows.
